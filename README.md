# Final project proposals

## Proposed groups due Nov 3

By the end of day on Tues, Nov 3, please let us know your group and
the proposed work (email Colin Ponce and David Bindel).

## Initial proposals due Oct 7

Your final project should involve understanding performance, either through
investigating performance of some particular code or method in a small research
paper or by explaining something about performance and parallelism in an
instructional module.  Within those constraints, you are free to propose
whatever projects you'd like!

In order to ensure that people start thinking about this, and in order to form
groups, please submit your *brief* project proposals in the form of a pull
request against this repository.  Use a name based on your GitHub ID; for
example, I might make a `dbindel.md` file (or `dbindel.pdf`) if I wanted to
propose something.  A one-line proposal with a URL pointing to another location
is also fine.  Note that you are *not* obliged to go with the project you
proposed if some other project sounds more interesting; conversely, if you are
passionate about your project idea and want to get others to join in, you
should write a compelling proposal.  I will collate an index after the
proposals are up.
