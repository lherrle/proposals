## Iterative Solvers in the FEAST Algorithm#### Nimit Sohoni (nss66)### IntroductionFEAST is an algorithm to find the eigenpairs of a matrix within a specified bounded region in the complex plane [1]. The algorithm applies the Cauchy residue theorem to contour integral of the Green’s function matrix. The contour integral of the Green’s function is approximated by a numerical quadrature scheme, with solves of smaller linear problems taking place at each quadrature point. Thus, this algorithm readily lends itself to parallelism, since the solves at each of the quadrature nodes can be done independently (and the algorithm can also be run on several search intervals in parallel).### Project GoalThe linear solvers used in the current version of the FEAST algorithm are exact solvers. My objective is to determine whether inexact, iterative solvers such as the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) can be used in place of exact solves, and can improve performance for matrices with certain types of structure. I will also come up with a parallelization method for this modified algorithm. This may be nontrivial, since preconditioners for the iterative solvers may come from the results at adjacent quadrature points, and implement this modified version of FEAST (most likely in C) with iterative solvers. Furthermore, time permitting, I will extend some of these approaches to the nonlinear eigenvalue problem, building on work done in this direction by Wolf-Jurgen Beyn [2].### References1. http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.1151122. http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1580
